## What does this bot do?

This script allows you to upload and sell **as many NFTs as you want to OpenSea**, all **automatically** and **quickly** (about 2.5 NFTs per minute). **All metadata are integrated**, and the **Ethereum** and **Polygon** Blockchains are supported.  

**You can decide whether you want to upload or sell your NFTs, or both**. If you upload your NFTs and sell them later, a CSV file is created with the URL of the NFT as well as its Blockchain and supply number.

➜ **If you sell any NFT with this bot, you can consider sharing some of your earnings**: 😉
**0xDD135d5be0a23f6daAAE7D2d0580828c9e09402E** (Ethereum).  
➜ **Or you can buy me a NFT from my collection [Crypto Parrot](https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-parrot-nfts) if this bot was useful to you**.


## Changelog

* **Version 1.5.10:**
  * Minor fixes concerning the `sale()` method of the OpenSea class.
  * Fixed exception iteration error.
* **Version 1.5.9:**
  * The `close()` method of the Webdriver class has been fixed. It creates an exception when listing NFTs. As a result, it does not try to list them a second time. **[#144](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/144), [#145](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/145), [#149](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/149)**.
  * During the download, when the webdriver starts, sometimes an error occurs and creates an exception. It was supposed to close the webdriver but it caused the bot to crash.
  * The download of webdriver requires a manual entry of the path after a number of failures.
* **Version 1.5.8:**
  * Errors related to incorrectly formatted files are now supported. An error is displayed but the bot does not stop abruptly. **[#90](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/90)**.
  * False listing errors are reduced, the robot checks a second time if the NFT is correctly listed.
* **Version 1.5.7:**
  * With each failed upload or sale, the bot retries a second time before saving the NFT data in an autogenerated file.
  * The duration has been fixed for GeckoDriver (Mozilla Firefox).  **[#121](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/121)**.
* **Version 1.5.6:**
  * The `dict_to_list()` method has been optimized and shortened.
  * Minor fixes.
* **Version 1.5.5:**
  * Fixed the `metamask_contract()` method. It was not signing the contract when completing the listing for the Ethereum Blockchain.
  * Minor fixes.
* **Version 1.5.4:**
  * The HTTPConnectionPool error in Selenium is fixed, it was caused by defining the driver inside a loop. Now the bot will print an error and restart to launch the bot. **[#112](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/112)**.  
    ➜ For more informations: **[Reddit - Ralphc360's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/comments/cuynft/comment/f85odbh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**.
  * You can now sell your NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain for free.
* **Version 1.5.3:**
  * Fixed the Webdriver-Manager module, it was downloading the ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver at each webdriver launch. Now it uses the path of the downloaded webdriver. **[#112](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/112)**.
  * Fixed the collection input. **[#108](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/108)**.
* **Version 1.5.2:**
  * Headless mode support. Download Mozilla Firefox and you can use this bot in the background without any interface.
    Note: Firefox may be unstable and some features may work differently or not at all.  **[#64](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/64), [#69](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/discussions/69), [#106](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/106)**.
  * Fixed the connection to the MetaMask success indicator.
* **Version 1.5.1:**
  * Fixed the problem of the worker version 1.5.0. The bot now continues to upload and does not restart the upload from the beginning. **[#107](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/107)**.
* **Version 1.5.0:**
  * The reCAPTCHAs can now be bypassed. The bot restarts for each upload - it's a bit slow but it works. **[#98](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/98), [#102](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/pull/102)**.  
    Thanks to **[Kanishka-Chandra](https://github.com/Kanishka-Chandra)** and **[elwanm](https://github.com/elwanm)**.
  * The bot restarts after 3 failed connections to the wallet or to OpenSea.
* **Version 1.4.9:**
  * Minor fixes.
  * Developers can now add new wallets if they wish.
  * ChromeDriver is automatically downloaded - no need to do it manually (`pip install -r requirements.txt` required).
  * _The reCAPTCHAs solver is not integrated/configured._
* **Version 1.4.8:**
  * <strike>Added a new feature that allows to upload more than 50 items in a collection. Requires to be activated (asked at launch).</strike> (Method used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wpmjh8xrXo). **Update:** This method is useless because [OpenSea went back on its words](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1486843201352716289). The limit has been removed.
  * Minor fix.
* **Version 1.4.7:**
  * The default language of ChromeDriver is now English to ensure maximum compatibility. The date did not work in some countries because of the different formats that OpenSea offers. **[#67](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/67)**.
  * Minor fix (Colorama module).
* **Version 1.4.6:**
  * The duration has been corrected. OpenSea does not allow to change the year when the next year is more than 6 months away. So it was impossible to enter the month without it being replaced by December (12 - maximum number because the year was entered instead); **Note: maximum duration is 6 months. [#55](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/55)**.
  * The connection to OpenSea has *certainly* been corrected. (need feedback about this - I don't have any problems on my side). **[#53](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/53), [#58](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/58), [#61](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/61)**.
* **Version 1.4.5:**
  * Minor fix for Linux users. The `clear_text(self)` method inserts an "A" when it tries to clear the inputs before sending the data. **[#39](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/39)**.
* **Version 1.4.4:**
  * Connection to OpenSea with MetaMask corrected. Download of the extension was requested. **[#53](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/53)**.
  * Connection to OpenSea with MetaMask improved.
* **Version 1.4.3:**
  * File preview is now added. **[#48](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/48)**.
* **Version 1.4.2:**
  * Listing of NFT on the Ethereum Blockchain is fully supported. **Be sure to make a deposit and have more than 0.05 ETH on your wallet.**
* **Version 1.4.1:**
  * Small fix for XLSX files. Empty cells were interpreted as "NaN", which is not interpreted as an empty string for Python. **[#18](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/18), [#23](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/23)**.
* **Version 1.4:**
  * You can now decide whether you want to upload or sell your NFTs, or both. **[#3](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/3), [#22](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/22)**.
  * Signing the MetaMask contract works every time. It can take 30 seconds to be signed when connecting to OpenSea. **[#5](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/5), [#17](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/17)**.
  * After uploading the NFT, the bot would crash when it tried to sell it (the URL was not correct). Now it doesn't. **[#17](https://github.com/maximedrn/opensea-automatic-bulk-upload-and-sale/issues/17)**.
  * MacOS and Linux support improved.
  * Calendar method improved.
* **Version 1.3:**

## Configuration of the sale part of the NFTs

When you want to sell your NFTs, Opensea requires various details according to their Blockchain or supply number.  
**Note: The maximum duration of sale should be at most 6 months. It must be entered in the form of start date - end date.**

## Known issues and important things to know

* Make sure to **deposit Ethereum (ETH/WETH)** or **Polygon (MATIC)** on your wallet before proceeding to the sale. Otherwise the bot will cancel the sale. Opensea needs an **Ethereum** wallet with more than **0.05 ETH** or a **Polygon** wallet with a deposit of **any amount**. For **Ethereum**, you have to make a first listing manually before using this bot.
* **The file path should not contain a unique "\\". It can be a "/" or a "\\\\", as you can see for the JSON file *(it applies to all file formats)*:**
  
  ```json
  // You can use this format for your path:
  "file_path": "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/MyNFTs/nft_0001.png",
  // or this one:
  "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\MyNFTs\\nft_0001.png",
  // but not this one (you can see that "\" is highlighted in red):
  "file_path": "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\MyNFTs\nft_0001.png",
  ```
* The bot may crash at the beginning when loading the MetaMask extension (a Selenium module issue), An error like the one below should appear:  
  
  ```python
  selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException:
  Message: unknown error: failed to wait for extension background page to load:
  chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefpgknn/background.html from timeout:
  Timed out receiving message from renderer: 10.000
  ```
* When lauching the webdriver, Selenium can raise an exception:
  
  ```python
  driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service( # DeprecationWarning using
  TypeError: WebDriver.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'service'
  ```
  You must update your Selenium version to 4.1.0 or higher by typing in the command prompt:
  
  ```
  pip install selenium --upgrade
  ```
  You can now verify that a more recent version of Selenium is installed by typing:
  
  ```
  pip show selenium
  ```
